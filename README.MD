Initial  MVP in still similar to before and that is a web application that is able to add posts and allow users to search these posts to make groups for various projects and topics that they set themselves or search for. This must have a login page and page to add topics. Optional additions are a chatbot NLP as well as file submission. I ideally would like to add a file submission as well as individual user profile pages that can be searched, however this requires more research on my end to implement now.
